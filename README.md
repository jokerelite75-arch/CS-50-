# C Algorithm Implementations

## Overview
This repository contains low-level C implementations of fundamental computer science algorithms, focusing on memory management, logical constraints, and efficiency.

## Key Projects

### 1. Mario (Pyramid Generation)
* **Description:** A program that recreates the pyramid structure from Super Mario Bros.
* **Technical Focus:** Implements nested loops and conditional logic to handle dynamic user input for height constraints. checks for valid integer input to prevent overflows.

### 2. Cash / Credit (Greedy Algorithm)
* **Description:** specific implementation for calculating minimum coinage.
* **Technical Focus:** Utilizes a **Greedy Algorithm** to optimize the change-making process, reducing computational steps for transaction processing.

## Technologies
* **Language:** C (Standard C99)
* **Tools:** Clang Compiler, Make
